Both vector and list have a member function bac k() that returns a reference to
the last element. To use it, you have to be sure that there really is a last element
for back() to refer to - don't use it on an empty container. That's why we defined
an empty Document to have one empty Line. Note that we store every character
from input, even the newline characters ('\n'). Storing those newline characters
greatly simplifies output, but you have to be careful how you define a character
count Gust counting characters will give a number that includes space and newÂ­
line characters).
